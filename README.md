# C++ Exercises Repository

Welcome to the C++ Exercises Repository! This repository contains folders dedicated to various C++ topics, covering a wide range of subjects from the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to mastering complex algorithms and problem-solving. Each subject is carefully crafted to enhance your understanding and proficiency in C++ programming.

## Subjects Covered

1. **Basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - Exercises covering fundamental concepts such as memory allocation, pointers, references, switch statements, ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and Orthodox Canonical class form.

2. **Inheritance and Polymorphism**
   - Exercises focusing on inheritance, subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces, and handling exceptions in C++.

3. **C++ Casts**
   - Exercises exploring the various types of casts available in C++, including static_cast, dynamic_cast, const_cast, and reinterpret_cast.

4. **C++ Templates**
   - Exercises delving into the powerful feature of templates in C++, including function templates, class templates, and template specialization.

5. **Bitcoin Exchanger**
   - Complex exercises simulating a Bitcoin exchange system, challenging your skills in data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving.

6. **Insertion Sort Algorithm**
   - Exercises dedicated to implementing and understanding the insertion sort algorithm, a fundamental sorting algorithm in computer science.

7. **Reverse Polish Notation**
   - Exercises focusing on the Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) and its implementation in C++, providing insights into stack-based algorithms and expression evaluation.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on the subjects covered. Each subject folder contains a set of exercises related to that topic. The exercises are further subdivided into smaller tasks, enabling a structured approach to learning and practice.
